This is a functional Weather App built using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The weather app will show the weather information that it will get from the API, an icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value in Celsius unit, the weather description, and then the user's city and country.

When the user clicks on the temperature value, that will convert it from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
